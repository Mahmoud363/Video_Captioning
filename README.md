# Video Captioning using Attention mechanism

## Architecture
- The model is based on an encoder decoder network which take as input the extracted features using the Xception model on 80 frames chosen based on the given interval.
- The attention mechanism used is the Bahdanau attention mechanism due to its efficiency and ease of implementation in tensflow
## Tools
 -	the model is done using Tensorflow 2.0 and tested on Quadro P5000
